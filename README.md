# NumberLuck

mini project about black cats, numbers and lucky and unlucky omens...

This game conceptually focuses on the everlasting presence of death, no matter what the player/viewers do they end up dying. I wanted to incorporate omens, symbolism, and pathetic fallacy as it is a superstitious and mystical presence in my own psyche. Within the context of this game, I ended up using common lucky/unlucky symbols and omens from different cultures. Additionally numbers play a role in creating chance encounters.

The point of this was to ensure that no player is aware of what every single symbol means nor what the numbers do.
